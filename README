THE SPV3 GUI
============

This repository contains the source for the SPV3 GUI, which is a simple
front-end to the SPV3 CLI. The CLI contains the main logic for the
entire loader, and the GUI merely serves to hide all of that away behind
a pretty interface.

One would argue that the logic should be extracted into a shared
library, rather than have the GUI simply call the CLI; however, the GUI
is an after-thought and is designed to be as simple as possible. In
essence, it just calls the CLI with the relevant arguments.
