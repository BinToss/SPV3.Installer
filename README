THE SPV3 GUI
============

This repository contains the source for the SPV3 GUI, which is a nifty
front-end to the HXE. The HXE contains the main logic for the entire
loader, whereas the GUI serves as an UI to the HXE loader and its
configuration.

Additionally, the SPV3 GUI permits automatic updating of SPV3 data, and
isolates the SPV3 campaign progress to its own dedicated directory.
