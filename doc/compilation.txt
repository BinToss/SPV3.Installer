COMPILING
=========

The SPV3 loader builds upon the HXE Compiler by:

-   having installation packages in a data subdirectory in the target
    directory;
-   creating copies of the loader & HXE executable for end-user
    convenience;

It is important to note that the loader will compile data in the
directory it's run from. As such, it should be placed in the SPV3 folder
which will be compiled into redistributable packages using HXE.

ENABLING
--------

To enable the UI for compiling SPV3 data, please create a blank file
named ...

    0xCOMPILE

... in the SPV3 folder which you are compiling the data from.

The loader will take care of not having this file be distributed to the
end-user.
