INSTALLATION
============

The SPV3 Loader is officially distributed with the mod; however, to
install it:

0.  please ensure you have .NET 4.6.1 installed on your system
1.  download an official archive (or compile the source yourself)
2.  move the files from the archive (or bin folder if compiled) to the
    SPV3 or HCE installation folders

UPDATING
--------

The SPV3 loader checks for updates on start-up. When an update is
available, click on the respective update button and download/open the
ZIP on your computer. Move the files inside it to your SPV3/HCE
installation, and replace any files if prompted.
