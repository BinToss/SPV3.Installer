INSTALLATION
============

The SPV3 Loader is officially distributed with the mod; however, to
install it:

0.  please ensure you have .NET 4.6.1 installed on your system
1.  download an official archive (or compile the source yourself)
2.  move the files from the archive (or bin folder if compiled) to the
    SPV3 or HCE installation folders

UPDATING
--------

The SPV3 loader checks for updates on start-up. When an update is
available, click on the respective update button and download/open the
ZIP on your computer. Move the files inside it to your SPV3/HCE
installation, and replace any files if prompted.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLING USING HXE
====================

Behind the scenes, HXE is what carries out the installation. The SPV3
loader is merely a graphical front-end to it. This means that you can
directly use HXE to install SPV3 from the command line.

STEP 1. EXTRACTING THE INSTALLER
--------------------------------

If you've downloaded the official installer, you can extract it using
7-Zip or WinRAR. To do so from the command line/terminal, invoke:

    7z x SPV3.2.0.exe SPV3

After you extract it, you will discover the following files:

        .
        |   hxe.exe
        |   setup.exe
        |   spv3_installer.exe
        |   
        \---data
                0003feda-a99f-413f-8742-f60303f4962d.bin
                [many more bin files]
                ffd08ef2-3dac-4da5-92bf-cb2dc2db7626.bin
                manifest.bin
                

STEP 2. COMBINING THE FILES
---------------------------

HXE can install the data from within the bin files to a specified path.
However, the HXE executable must first be moved into the same directory
as the bin files:

    mv hxe.exe data

After invoking that command, the data subdirectory should now contain
the hxe.exe, manifest.bin and all of the randomly named bin files.

The reason we've done this is because HXE will read the manifest.bin and
extract the data from the discovered bin files, into the relevant paths.

STEP 3. INSTALLING SPV3
-----------------------

With the HXE executable, manifest.bin and bin files all in the same
directory, you may now invoke the following command in your terminal:

    .\hxe.exe -install C:\SPV3

The above command will instruct HXE to install SPV3 to "C:\SPV3.2".

You may change the path as you see fit. Do be careful that specifying
the Program Files directory will require administrative permissions all
the time.

NOTE: On WINE, you will have to use a forward slash (/):

          ./hxe.exe -install ~/path/to/spv3

You should now have a fully installed copy of SPV3. To use it without
the loader, simply run the HXE executable in your SPV3 installation
folder directly.
