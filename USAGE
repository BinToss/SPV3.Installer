USAGE
=====

First, ensure that .NET 4.6 is installed and that the SPV3 loader and
its files are placed in the SPV3 or HCE folder.

To load, simply click on the Load SPV3 button. To configure, review the
Loader Settings and check out the information for each option.

To use HXE directly, invoke the hxe.exe executable the exact same way
you would invoke haloce.exe - that is, either double click on it, or
provide HCE arguments such as -window or -vidmode 1920,1080,60 as you
see fit. Its USAGE document goes into further detail.
