=======
## SharpUtils  
This is a personal class library of common utility/helper classes that I frequently make use of in my various C# projects.  
Their uses range from File IO related to Web related. The classes are grouped in a folder with the name of the particular  
thing they focus on  + Utils at the end(EG: classes focusing on WebRequests are in a folder called WebUtils).  
The classes are also all in a namespace they all share with the same name as the containing folder.
  
## Current Utility List  
### WebUtils  
Contains various helper/util classes related to making external  
web requests.  
*WebRequests.cs*: Helps make simple requests (downloading a string, parsing JSON, etc)  
*GithubReleaseParser.cs*: Helps get the latest released version of a given Repo,  
and also has a function which does a check to see if the current application version  
is not the currently released one.  
*GithubReadmeParser.cs*: Helps get a specific line from a README.MD file starting with  
a prefix, so I can for example, have a line in a README.MD file "Reddit Thread: link_here"  
and search for the line starting with "Reddit Thread" and then get the link.  
### WPFUtils  
Contains various helper/util classes related to WPF projects.  
*WindowHelper.cs*: Checks if a window of a certain type is currently open in the host  
WPF Application.  
### FileUtils  
Contains various helper/util classes related to File IO.  
*DialogHelpers.cs*: Simple OpenFileDialog/OpenFolderDialog helpers. Bare bones right now.  
*FileSizeHelper.cs*: Helps convert Bytes to a human readable string representation.  
### MiscUtils
Utilities/Helpers which don't fit anywhere else will go here.
*AdminCheckHelper.cs*: Checks if the current application is being run as an administrator.
*WriteMemoryHelper.cs*: Provides a PINVOKE wrapper around WriteProcessMemory.
  
## State of the code  
At the moment, the existing utilities are not extensively tested, as I only recently  
developed them for StarboundAssetUnpacker, so there's probably some things which need  
to be worked out. I think they all work as they should though from what I've seen using  
them in that project though.
  
## Usage  
I've tried to document the code the best I can with XML documentation comments.  
All the classes are static (since... I really don't see the point in using OOP related  
constructs for simple things like this). I've also tried to make sure all the functions  
have no side effects - they just take something in, and then pop something out in return.  
  
This is licensed under the *GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE*, so feel free to take the code  
and do with it what you will.  
  
## Credits  
Since I don't like copying code from someone else without giving due credit, I should  
note that I got the code for the GetHumanReadableSize function from this StackOverflow  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/281640/how-do-i-get-a-human-readable-file-size-in-bytes-abbreviation-using-net  
I originally did use my own code to do it but it wasn't very elegant and I didn't have time  
to try to roll my own since I was more interested in the task at hand.
